# Weather-Journal App Project

This is my second project, and I'm hoping to be successful in putting the tools I've acquired to work on the tasks at hand.

## Overview

- I designed an asynchronous web app that dynamically updates the UI using a Web API and user data.
- When writing the code, I utilized ES6.
- I made some changes to the HTML and CSS files in order to make the layout as basic as possible.
- To acquire the Celsius Temperature, I used Extention on the URL (&units=metric).
- To make the code more readable, I added comments.

# Instructions for use

- All you have to do is write the city's ZIP code (United States).
- If you like, you can write down your emotions. [optional].
- You will be shown by the application.

- the time and date
- the ambient temperature
- your emotions
- the location's name
